# Cardio-disease-ML-GroupProject
 ❤️ Cardio Disease  group project as part of Machine Learning subject in the HD in Science in Data Analysis for Business.

Machine Learning Project – Heart Disease Prediction
📓 Group members:
Rula Abu Affar
Sirlene Andreis 
Pamela Neh Ambe 
Sarah Parsons 


Under supervision of Dr. Muhammad Iqbal


We built 4 Machine Learning models based in a Cardio dataset, models used are:
Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression

Random Forest 

ANN - Artificial Neural Network

Each model was split in three different sizes, test with 10%, 20% and 30% od the data.
